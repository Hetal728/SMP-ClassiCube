[2014/04/12 22:44:34] masterofpower: hetal, Hardman or Protoman whistle?
[2014/04/12 22:44] <*Hetal> Its due to the risk that some people might use the software
[2014/04/12 22:44] <*Hetal> and make this server die
[2014/04/12 22:44:57] AKohn: Can I see it?

[2014/04/12 22:50] <*Hetal> look plugins in python aren't gonna be compiled
[2014/04/12 22:50] <*Hetal> Just make a txt file called plugins.txt
[2014/04/12 22:51] <*Hetal> and make it import modules
[2014/04/12 22:51] <*Hetal> Welcome
[2014/04/12 22:51] <*Hetal> I didn't know this was accessible through mc.net
[2014/04/12 22:51] <*Hetal> Shouldn't be
[2014/04/12 22:51] <*Hetal> nope
[2014/04/12 22:51:31] masterofpower: this server?

[2014/04/12 22:52] <*Hetal> then import it as a regular module
[2014/04/12 22:52:19] AKohn: no
[2014/04/12 22:52] <*Hetal> its python, not C# where you have to compile stuff
[2014/04/12 22:52] <*Hetal> What do you mean?

[2014/04/12 22:53:09] AKohn: import core.constants

[2014/04/14 00:28] <*_123DMWM> in c#
[2014/04/14 00:28] <*_123DMWM> so I'm already intrigued

[2014/04/14 00:41] <*Hetal> _123DMWM yep
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*Hetal> _123DMWM Why are you interested in Evolve tho?
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*Hetal> I thought you were a MCLawl hater
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*_123DMWM> it's writtin in C#
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*_123DMWM> and doesn't start with MC
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*_123DMWM> legit the only two reasons
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*Hetal> _123DMWM MCLawl is written in C#
[2014/04/14 00:44] <*Hetal> Plus Evolve is a MCLawl fork
[2014/04/14 00:45] <*_123DMWM> MCLawl starts with MC
[2014/04/14 00:45] <*Hetal> yes but Evolve is a MCLawl fork
[2014/04/14 00:45] <*_123DMWM> one of my passwords to something is fCraftMasterRace
[2014/04/14 00:46] <*Hetal> let me try to ghost you :3

[2014/04/14 00:46] <*_123DMWM> lel
[2014/04/14 00:47] <*Hetal> My proof that it's a MCLawl fork
[2014/04/14 00:47] <*Hetal> And I'm an MCLawl lover :D
[2014/04/14 00:47] <*Hetal> Well just gonna fork CC and modify it to NeonGaming's likings into a SMP client
[2014/04/14 00:49] <*Hetal> https://github.com/NeonGaming/SMP-Applet
[2014/04/14 00:49] <*Hetal> I'm gonna get working
[2014/04/14 00:49] <*Hetal> Drowning is accurate correct?
[2014/04/14 00:49] <*_123DMWM> somewhat, server starts like a second after the bubbles
[2014/04/14 00:49] <*_123DMWM> but stays accurate after
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*Hetal> and is fall damage accurate?
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*_123DMWM> it doesn't do fall damage
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*Hetal> server or client?
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*Hetal> Server does fall damage
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*_123DMWM> client
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*Hetal> oh
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*Hetal> Well then how would we make hearts for that?
[2014/04/14 00:50] <*_123DMWM> I could make it respond to "FALL DAMAGE: BLAH"
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*_123DMWM> like from chat
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*_123DMWM> and it would set player health
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*Hetal> um sure I guess
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*Hetal> I'll try to work on something 
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*Hetal> Trying to figure out what
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*_123DMWM> because I still can;t find where packets are set in server code
[2014/04/14 00:51] <*_123DMWM> XD

[2014/04/14 14:38] <*ane200055> But the Java doesnt even let me allocate 2GB RAM
[2014/04/14 14:39] <*ane200055> Or 1.5GB
[2014/04/14 14:39:15] Hetal728: CC allocates around 700 MB
[2014/04/14 14:39] <*ane200055> Any higher than what I have it'll crash.
[2014/04/14 14:39] <*Hetal_> well you working on client?

[2014/04/14 14:41] <*Hetal_> well through cgi
[2014/04/14 14:41] <*Hetal_> but they suck

[2014/04/14 14:43] <*Hetal_> _Retaliate_ This is just a random question, why the facecam on the video?
[2014/04/14 14:44] <*ane200055> I thought the same.
[2014/04/14 14:44] <*ane200055> lell
[2014/04/14 14:44] <*Hetal_> joppie : Thanks! Now I understand what everything does instead of not knowing what everything does...
[2014/04/14 14:44] <*Hetal_> He saw my long explanation of every file
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*ane200055> lol
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*ane200055> Does Joppie Python?
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> Well translating from Python to C#, Protocol.py is like a Player.cs, Console.py is like Logger.cs but includes console commands, BlockStore.py is what stores and saves the level, Physics.py is basically Physics.cs, PlControl.py controls the plugins, the plugin folder is basically the command folder, Logger.py is a simple logger, Server.py is like S
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> erver.cs of course, timer.py is the timer that the daemon (server) uses, world.py is like Level.cs, entities is sortof like Block.cs except it is used to control mobs, templates is a bunch of terrains (that most likely won't work). Sorry if it's confusing :shock:
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> idk
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*ane200055> lol
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> His first response was
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> Whoa! Awesome! Another new "game mode"! :D 
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> I don't understand the source even thought it's there(I don't know what every file does).
[2014/04/14 14:45] <*Hetal_> I'd love to contribute thougtht. <ok>
[2014/04/14 14:46] <*ane200055> Doesnt seem that hard to understand.
[2014/04/14 14:47] <*Hetal_> funny thing is that he hasn't even came on the server
[2014/04/14 14:47] <*Hetal_> and he said that it is awesome

[2014/04/25 18:43] <*Hetal> To tell the truth, Lee has never went out of the MCLawl interface and i bet the client was fully _Retaliate_'s work
[2014/04/25 18:43] <*Hetal> ane200055 : If you find a good SMF2 theme for the forum, I'll install it
[2014/04/25 18:43] <*ane200055> I think he just used .Contains("*playerlist")) for his MCDz IRC bot
[2014/04/25 18:44] <*Hetal> yes 100% he did
[2014/04/25 18:44] <*Hetal> He didn't even reference it as a separate program
[2014/04/25 18:44] <*Hetal> he made it as a cmd
[2014/04/25 18:44] <*Hetal> allowing minimal customization 
[2014/04/25 18:44] <*ane200055> I would .Split the the raw string
[2014/04/25 18:45] <*ane200055> Then it should be int 3
[2014/04/25 18:45] <*Hetal> ane200055 : http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=447122.0
[2014/04/25 18:45] <*Hetal> is that good?

[2014/04/25 18:48] <*Hetal> I'll test the LS stuff in a sec
[2014/04/25 18:48] <*Hetal> need to install theme first
[2014/04/25 18:48] <*ane200055> What software r we usin
[2014/04/25 18:48] <*Hetal> We're using my custom software I spent my entire spring break coding
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> which i have no idea if it works
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> everything should work other than it listing the survivors at the end of a round
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*ane200055> You must take coding serious
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> Yes I do
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*ane200055> Do you even code at school? lawl
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> i think
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> Well
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> I've been assigned for it next year
[2014/04/25 18:49] <*Hetal> By all teachers
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*ane200055> For I.T.
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> yes
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*ane200055> Or ICT or w.e
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> Except it'll be more like a gifted place
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> There are 2 coding classes
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> Coding
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> and Advanced Coding
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> Both include IT
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*Hetal> but advanced is like gifted
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*ane200055> Are you not the only coder in your school?
[2014/04/25 18:50] <*ane200055> o.
[2014/04/25 18:51] <*Hetal> most likely not 
[2014/04/25 18:51] <*Hetal> My school is a 6-12 grade school

[2014/04/26 19:48] <*Hetal> well yea, hypereddie found them
[2014/04/26 19:48] <*Hetal> Now we wait for his reply
[2014/04/26 19:51] <*ane200055> What is the best:
[2014/04/26 19:51] <*ane200055> Irris or WeeChat?
[2014/04/26 19:51] <*Hetal> WeeChat
[2014/04/26 19:52] <*ane200055> I might install it on dis dedi
[2014/04/26 19:52] <*ane200055> When I gets it
[2014/04/26 19:54] <*ane200055> i0i
[2014/04/26 19:54] <*ane200055> My bro's playing Halo.
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*Hetal> wait
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*Hetal> Your buying a dedi?
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*ane200055> no
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*Hetal> who's dedi then :P
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*ane200055> Remember CN's VPS went down, I said about it and.
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*ane200055> He was like "u can us mah dedi"
[2014/04/26 19:55] <*Hetal> o
[2014/04/26 19:56] <*ane200055> Isn't Cookie kind?
[2014/04/26 19:56] <*Hetal> Let me see if I can get something out of this
[2014/04/26 19:56] <*Hetal> hehe
[2014/04/26 19:56] <*Hetal> Yes he is
[2014/04/26 19:56] <*Hetal> 7:56:33 PM <*__*> hey old buddy whats up?
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*ane200055> I WONDER IF I CAN RUN HALO AND MC SERVERS OFF IT :O
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*ane200055> Who was that?
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*Hetal> you could
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*Hetal> Good thing about it is that it is 16GB
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*Hetal> meaning that we could host a multi-server network aka hub server
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*ane200055> How about bandwidth?
[2014/04/26 19:57] <*ane200055> Unlimited? o-o
[2014/04/26 19:58] <*Hetal> Well bandwidth wouldn't matter too much as its not MCPE
[2014/04/26 19:58] <*Hetal> MCPE doesn't compress the packets before sending unlike MC
[2014/04/26 19:58] <*ane200055> I would've thought a lotta devices wouldnt like it.
[2014/04/26 19:59] <*ane200055> But it seems to work.
[2014/04/26 20:00] <*ane200055> Hey Hetal, random but, do you think Lee doesn't know what endl is?
[2014/04/26 20:00] <*Hetal> Bet he doesn't
[2014/04/26 20:00] <*Hetal> Lol
[2014/04/26 20:00] <*ane200055> I'm not saying he's a bad coder, he's just not great...
[2014/04/26 20:01] <*Hetal> ye
[2014/04/26 20:02] <*ane200055> Do you have a dedi or just a bunch of single VPS'?
[2014/04/26 20:02] <*Hetal> only 1 VPS atm
[2014/04/26 20:02] <*Hetal> Planning to buy a dedi soon
[2014/04/26 20:03] <*ane200055> There's gotta be some way of getting Halo servers to run on Linux...
[2014/04/26 20:03] <*ane200055> Some dude got Halo 1 running on Ubuntu lol
[2014/04/26 20:04] <*ane200055> MCPE would be cool too
[2014/04/26 20:04] <*ane200055> MCPE, like you say, could be a bandwidth whore.
[2014/04/26 20:05] <*ane200055> So, could be.. idk
[2014/04/26 20:05] <*Hetal> yea
[2014/04/26 20:05] <*Hetal> It will be a bandwidth whore until 0.9.0
[2014/04/26 20:06] <*ane200055> Omg, I am so looking forward to 0.9.0
[2014/04/26 20:06] <*Hetal> lol
[2014/04/26 20:06] <*ane200055> Currently, MCPE is a pain
[2014/04/26 20:06] <*ane200055> And limited
[2014/04/26 20:07] <*ane200055> But I'm giving it chances :3
[2014/04/26 20:07] <*ane200055> So MCPE will support compress packets as of 0.9.0?
[2014/04/26 20:08] <*Hetal> They should as they're adding infinity worlds
[2014/04/26 20:08] <*Hetal> or else bandwidth killer has arrived
[2014/04/26 20:14] <*ane200055> oh my.......
[2014/04/26 20:14] <*ane200055> The console versions don't have infinity world's.
[2014/04/26 20:14] <*ane200055> -'

[2014/04/26 21:38] <*Hetal> unless you want a premium server
[2014/04/26 21:38] <*Hetal> which is what I want :D
[2014/04/26 21:38] <*Hetal> well it really wouldn't matter for you D:

[2014/04/26 21:40] <*Hetal> So you want premium or ClassiCube running on my PC?
[2014/04/26 21:40] <*ane200055> "o lok mi pc haz 8gigz o' ram"

[2014/04/26 21:42] <*Hetal> Premium Hub server vs a few CC servers
[2014/04/26 21:42] <*Hetal> So 1 Premium server vs 3 CC servers
[2014/04/26 21:43] <*Hetal> thats the matchup

[2014/04/26 21:44] <*Hetal> We can host 2 CC servers on Liam's
[2014/04/26 21:44] <*Hetal> and 1 Premium server or 3 CC servers on my PC
[2014/04/26 21:44] <*Hetal> which is 24/7 at most times
[2014/04/26 21:45] <*ane200055> How the hell can people code to music when wearing headphones.
[2014/04/26 21:45] <*ane200055> I haven't tried it but

[2014/04/26 23:42] <*ane200055> ONLY THE GREATEST
[2014/04/26 23:42] <*ane200055> C++ can lead to system crashes
[2014/04/26 23:42] <*ane200055> Java is dumb

[2014/04/26 23:42] <*ane200055> Yes.
[2014/04/26 23:43] <*ane200055> Python is AHHH
[2014/04/26 23:43] <*ane200055> And.
[2014/04/26 23:43] <*ane200055> I made a point
[2014/04/26 23:43] <*Hetal> So lets find ourselves a gamemode that is reasonable
[2014/04/26 23:43] <*ane200055> What's your favourite language? :)
[2014/04/26 23:44] <*ane200055> And I can't think of much.

[2014/04/26 23:47] <*ane200055> Block hunt
[2014/04/26 23:47] <*Hetal> already done
[2014/04/26 23:47] <*Hetal> just need to test it later
[2014/04/26 23:47] <*Hetal> anything else?
[2014/04/26 23:47] <*ane200055> I can't think of much that HASNT been done
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> well
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*ane200055> Even Portal has been done.
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> think of some impopular stuff people will like if brought back
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> Portal was done in Lua by copygirl
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> in Obsidian
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> super old
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*Hetal> 4 years
[2014/04/26 23:48] <*ane200055> Is it open source ? o-o
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> yes
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> But recently, the bug is too hard to fix
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*ane200055> So you even know Lua?
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> A bit
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> um
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> Ik what you're thinking
[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> "No"

[2014/04/26 23:49] <*Hetal> Um
[2014/04/26 23:50] <*Hetal> Lets think of a gamemode that isnt on the serverlist atm
[2014/04/26 23:50] <*ane200055> "No"??
[2014/04/26 23:50] <*Hetal> I can't fix portal plugin for Obsidian
[2014/04/26 23:50] <*ane200055> kk
[2014/04/26 23:51] <*Hetal> so
[2014/04/26 23:51] <*Hetal> any gamemodes that are easy to code and arent on the serverlist?
[2014/04/26 23:52] <*ane200055> I really can't think of anything.
[2014/04/26 23:52] <*ane200055> D:
[2014/04/26 23:52] <*Hetal> um
[2014/04/26 23:52] <*Hetal> NOO

[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> So
[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> HideNSeek is too buggy to host atm, so is CTF
[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> We're waiting for LS
[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> We haven't decided on 1 gamemode
[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> so we only can host ZS atm
[2014/04/27 17:58] <*Hetal> which will be on the VPS i guess
[2014/04/27 18:00] <*Hetal> ane200055 : Unless you have a software you want to host the ZS with, we're using MCDzienny atm
